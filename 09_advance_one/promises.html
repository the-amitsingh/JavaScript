    <h2>The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>A Promise is in one of these states:</p>
        <li style="font-size: 14px;">pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 14px;">fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 14px;">rejected: meaning that the operation failed.</li>
